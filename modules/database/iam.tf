# By default, Cloud SQL blocks access to incoming connections. In order to connect, we need to give it
# a Google Cloud service account. We can do this using workload identity, which allows us to
# use a Kubernetes service account to authenticate to a Google Cloud service account. The k8s service account
# will be connected to our resources, and Google Cloud will magically use the GCloud service account
# to authenticate and allow access to resources.

# Create the service account:
resource "google_service_account" "db" {
  account_id = "${var.instance_name}-access"
  display_name = "${var.instance_name} service account"
}

# Make the kubernetes service account:
resource "kubernetes_service_account" "db" {
  metadata {
    name = "${var.instance_name}-db-access"

    # We need to annotate the service account with the Google Cloud service account's email.
    # This will tell kubernetes that the service account should be connected to the Google Cloud service account.
    annotations = {
      "iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account" = google_service_account.db.email
    }

    labels = {
      "app.kubernetes.io/name" = "database"
      "app.kubernetes.io/instance" = "${var.instance_name}"
      "app.kubernetes.io/component" = "db-access-sa"
      "app.kubernetes.io/part-of" = "mastodon"
      "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by" = "terraform"
    }
  }
}

# Tell GCloud that the k8s service account should be connected to the GCloud service account.
# This is accomplished using the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` role. The `member` of this policy binding
# is a service account with the following format: `serviceAccount:<project-id>.svc.id.goog[<namespace>/<service-account-name>]`.
# The square brackets must be included.
